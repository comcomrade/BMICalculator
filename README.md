# BMICalculator
BMICalculator lets you find out your BMI index and whether it is normal or not.

This app is the first app I create to learn about Kotlin and Android Development using Android Studio.

Here is the formula to calculate the BMI index on Wikipedia: [Body Mass Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index#:~:text=When%20the%20term-,BMI,-is%20used%20informally)

Here are some screenshoots of the UI of the app:
